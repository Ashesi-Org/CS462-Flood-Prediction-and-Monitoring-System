# **üåä Flood Prediction and Monitoring System**

The **Flood Prediction and Monitoring System** is a cloud-based web application designed to help predict and monitor flood risks in vulnerable areas, particularly in flood-prone regions of Ghana, like Accra. This system provides crucial insights to help individuals, government agencies, and developers take proactive measures to mitigate the impacts of flooding. Flooding in urban areas often leads to property damage, economic loss, and even loss of life. This project aims to address these challenges by offering accessible, data-driven flood risk assessments.

### Model Accuracy
Our local model achieved an outstanding accuracy of **98%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting flood risks.

### Cloud Hosting for Robust Models
Cloud computing plays a critical role in hosting resource-intensive models like the RAG system due to its scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. By leveraging cloud infrastructure, the robust model can efficiently handle high computational and storage demands, ensuring reliable performance and accessibility for users.

The decision to host the system on a different cloud provider underscores the importance of matching resource requirements to the provider's capabilities, including GPU-optimized virtual machines, data storage solutions, and low-latency networking. Additionally, cloud platforms enable seamless integration of diverse data sources and distributed processing of tasks, vital for real-time operations in complex systems like the RAG model.

This approach ensures:
- **High Availability**: Reliable system uptime and accessibility for users.
- **Improved Response Times**: Faster prediction and monitoring capabilities.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Ability to scale resources based on workload demands.
