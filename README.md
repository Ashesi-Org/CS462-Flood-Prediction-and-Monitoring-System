üåä Flood Prediction and Monitoring System
The Flood Prediction and Monitoring System is a cloud-based web application designed to help predict and monitor flood risks in vulnerable areas, particularly in flood-prone regions of Ghana, like Accra. This system provides crucial insights that can help individuals, government agencies, and developers take proactive measures to mitigate the impacts of flooding. Flooding is a major issue in urban areas, often resulting in property damage, economic loss, and even loss of life. This project aims to address these issues by offering accessible, data-driven flood risk assessments.

üöÄ Features
Data Collection: Real-time collection of rainfall, historical flood events, and environmental factors.
Predictive Analysis: Uses environmental data to calculate flood risks based on recent or forecasted rainfall levels.
Location-Specific Insights: Users can input or view flood risk predictions for specific areas, receiving a risk level overview.
User-Friendly Interface: A cloud-based web app with interactive visualizations and easy navigation for monitoring flood risks.
üîç How It Works
The Flood Prediction and Monitoring System operates by:

Data Aggregation: Gathering data from various sources, including rainfall measurements, past flood events, and geographic data.
Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning models to analyze collected data and predict the likelihood of a flood in specific areas.
User Input and Analysis: Allows users to input specific location data for customized flood risk insights.
Visualization and Monitoring: Displays real-time and forecasted flood risk levels for selected regions through interactive charts and maps.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for interactive data visualization.
Backend: Python with Flask to handle web application logic and data processing.
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow for predictive modeling.
Database: PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.
Cloud Services: AWS or Google Cloud for real-time data access and scalability.
Container Infrastructure: Docker for containerized deployment of the application.
üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Setup

üß™ Testing
We performed rigorous testing to ensure the application runs smoothly and meets all functional requirements:

Testing Suite: Utilized the Qodo Gen Test Suite for automated tests of APIs and containerized services.
API Testing: Conducted thorough API response testing using Postman to validate endpoints and ensure accurate data handling.
üìã Limitations and Future Improvements
Latency: There is some latency when retrieving API responses. Future work will involve optimizing API response times to ensure seamless user experience.
Expanded Data Sources: Adding more diverse data sources for better prediction accuracy.
Real-Time Notifications: Implementing real-time alert systems for high-risk flood zones.
üìä Data Sources and Collection
The system relies on multiple data sources to provide accurate flood predictions:

Weather Data: Real-time and historical rainfall data from government agencies and APIs like OpenWeather or Meteostat.
Flood History: Data on past flooding events in the targeted regions.
Geographical Information: Data on elevation, topography, and drainage systems from sources like Google Maps API or GIS databases.
üìà Machine Learning and Modeling
Flood predictions are made using machine learning algorithms trained on a variety of flood-related environmental data. Models include:

Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification of flood risk.
Random Forest: Used for assessing flood risk probability based on environmental factors.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): For time-series forecasting of rainfall and its potential impacts on flood risks.
