# **üåä Flood Prediction and Monitoring System**

The **Flood Prediction and Monitoring System** is a cloud-based web application designed to help predict and monitor flood risks in vulnerable areas, particularly in flood-prone regions of Ghana, like Accra. This system provides crucial insights to help individuals, government agencies, and developers take proactive measures to mitigate the impacts of flooding. Flooding in urban areas often leads to property damage, economic loss, and even loss of life. This project aims to address these challenges by offering accessible, data-driven flood risk assessments.

## **üöÄ Features**

- **Data Collection**: Real-time collection of rainfall, historical flood events, and environmental factors.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses environmental data to calculate flood risks based on recent or forecasted rainfall levels.
- **Location-Specific Insights**: Users can input or view flood risk predictions for specific areas, receiving a risk level overview.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A cloud-based web app with interactive visualizations and easy navigation for monitoring flood risks.

---

## **üîç How It Works**

The **Flood Prediction and Monitoring System** operates by:

1. **Data Aggregation**: Gathering data from various sources, including rainfall measurements, past flood events, and geographic data.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Using machine learning models to analyze collected data and predict the likelihood of a flood in specific areas.
3. **User Input and Analysis**: Allows users to input specific location data for customized flood risk insights.
4. **Visualization and Monitoring**: Displays real-time and forecasted flood risk levels for selected regions through interactive charts and maps.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for interactive data visualization.
- **Backend**: Python with Flask to handle web application logic and data processing.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow for predictive modeling.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS or Google Cloud for real-time data access and scalability.
- **Container Infrastructure**: Docker for containerized deployment of the application.

## **üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Setup**

### **Container Infrastructure**

The system uses a containerized infrastructure to streamline development and deployment. Below is the container setup:

1. **Containers**:
   - `user_tracking` container for logging and tracking user activity.
   - `database` container for managing flood prediction data.
   - `mwin7/landingpage` for the frontend interface.
   - `mwin7/backendlogin` for secure user login management.

2. **Images Created**:
   - `evansjunior/flood-prediction-app:latest`: The main application image.
   - `evansjunior/user-prediction-app:latest`: The user tracking application image.

## **üìã Limitations and Future Improvements**

Latency: There is some latency when retrieving API responses. Future work will involve optimizing API response times to ensure seamless user experience.
Expanded Data Sources: Adding more diverse data sources for better prediction accuracy.
Real-Time Notifications: Implementing real-time alert systems for high-risk flood zones.

## ** üìä Data Sources and Collection**
The system relies on multiple data sources to provide accurate flood predictions:

Weather Data: Real-time and historical rainfall data from government agencies and APIs like OpenWeather or Meteostat.
Flood History: Data on past flooding events in the targeted regions.
Geographical Information: Data on elevation, topography, and drainage systems from sources like Google Maps API or GIS databases.

## ** üìà Machine Learning and Modeling**
Flood predictions are made using machine learning algorithms trained on a variety of flood-related environmental data. Models include:

Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification of flood risk.
Random Forest: Used for assessing flood risk probability based on environmental factors.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): For time-series forecasting of rainfall and its potential impacts on flood risks.
